# Chapter 5: Probability

### This is a chapter that gives you the opportunity to cover various topics in probability.

## Learning Objectives
A basic understanding of probability and statistics is vital to becoming a
data scientist. Afterall, that is what makes you different from a software
engineer. Please complete this chapter before moving on to ```Chapter_6_statistics```.

  - Counting: permutation/combination (python module: `itertools`)
  - Conditional probability and Bayes formula
  - Probability distribution functions for discrete random variables (binomial, geometric, Poisson distributions)
  - Probability distibution for continuous random variables (uniform, normal, exponential distributions)
  - Generating simulations in python (python module `scipy` and in particular `scipy.stats`)

## Main Resources
If you feel like you need a review, there are very abridged lecture notes in
the `resources` folder that will catch you up to speed. Here is a recommended order to read the lecture notes in:

 - combinatorics_lecture
 - conditional_probability_lecture
 - random_variables_lecture
 - binomial_lecture
 - poisson_lecture
 - normal_exponential_lecture

## Assignments

The following assignments cover various aspects of basic probability theory. They represent the baseline understanding you need to have about probability to understand the course material we are going to cover in the future weeks. They also allow you to use `itertools` module once more, as well as to use `scipy.stats`.

### 1. Counting

The first assignment focuses on counting, with permutations and combinatorics. Answer the 4 questions in the [counting assignment](assignments/assignment_1_counting.md).

### 2. Conditional probability

The second assignment is centered on conditional probability, with many application of Bayes formula. Answer the 3 questions on [Bayes formula](assignments/assignment_2_conditional_proba.md).

### 3. Probability distributions for discrete and continuous random variables

The third assignment gives you the opportunity to explore 3 probability distributions for discrete random variables (binomial, geometric, Poisson) and 3 probaility distributions for continuous random variables (uniform, normal, exponential). Take a look at these [probability distributions](assignments/assignment_3_probability_distribution.md). You will write some functions to simulate experiments by generate samples from given distributions to get a probability of interest.
