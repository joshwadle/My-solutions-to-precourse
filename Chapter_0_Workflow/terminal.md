## Install and use a Terminal


#### iTerm2
The native Terminal is tucked away in MacOs Utilities and rarely used by everyday users. But it's a major tool for a Data Scientist!

During the program, we will be using iTerm2. [Install the stable release](https://www.iterm2.com/downloads.html).
- Tip: pin it in your Dashboard, you will be using this app a lot!
- Curious to know why we recommend iTerm2? Read this [apple.stackexchange conversation](http://apple.stackexchange.com/questions/25143/what-is-the-difference-between-iterm2-and-terminal).

**Linux note:** You can use the native Linux terminal.

#### Brew Install

Homebrew is a Mac package utility. To install a package, type the following in the command line `$ brew install package-name` (NB: do no actually type the `$` sign, this just indicates a command line environment). To see which packages are installed: `$ brew list`.

Install the following package and research what it does on Google (you will be using in to check your assignment).

  ```
  $ brew install tree
  ```

**DO NOT INSTALL MACPORTS ON THE WORKSTATIONS.**

**Linux Note:** Brew is just for Mac, in Linux you will need to use

  ```
  $ sudo apt-get install <package>
  ```

#### Command line
[Assignment 2](assignments/assignment_2_command_line.md): Use commands such as `ls`, `cd directory`, `cd ..`, `mkdir new-dir`, `rm some-file`, `mv`, etc to complete the [assignment_2_command_line.md](assignments/assignment_2_command_line.md). Feel free to go through the [sample version](assignments/assignment_2_command_line_sample.md) to get to know basic commands and to use the [cheatsheet](resources/command_line_basics.md) at first.
