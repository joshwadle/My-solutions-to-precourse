Having a structured and effective workflow is foundational to your success at Galvanize and as a data scientist in the wild.

it'll be easier to get help from the instructors if you're following the
Galvanize Way.

#### Keyboard shortcuts

[Assignment 6](assignments/assignment_6_avoiding_mouse.md): It's a good idea to start learning how to navigate and work without a mouse. This will come in very handy when you will be accessing remote machine and will not have the possibility to use a mouse to switch from one app to the next or from one window to the next.

The aim of [assignment_6_avoiding_mouse.md](assignments/assignment_6_avoiding_mouse.md) is to take you over some of the concepts you have been introduced to in this chapter. Try to do it without your mouse! A [cheatsheet](resources/Keyboard_Shortcuts.md) is available to help you with shortcuts.
