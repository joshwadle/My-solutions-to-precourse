# Assignment: Working with Command Lines

## Objectives
You will be using command lines to create, move and rename files and directories.

If you have never used a Terminal before, follow the guided steps in [assignment_2_command_line_sample.md](assignment_2_command_line_sample.md). This will show you the commands you need to type to create directory, move them, copy files and delete them.

If you are somewhat familiar with a Terminal, figure out the right command lines to achieve the action items described below. The command lines, in the order you typed them, should be placed in the YOUR ANSWER placeholder.

A [cheatsheet](../resources/command_line_basics.md) is available to help you.

## Questions

Do not use finder, just stay in the Terminal

1. Make a `testing_directory` on your Desktop.
2. Inside this directory, make a `code` directory, a `data` directory, a `raw_data` directory and a `test` directory.
3. 3. Enter the `testing_directory` and create a `readme.md` file and a `do_not_readme.md` file with Atom.
4. Create a `simple_script.py` in the `test` directory with Atom, add the following text: `print('Hello World!')`.
5. Place the `raw_data` directory inside the `data` directory.
6. Get the new path to the `raw_data` directory.
7. Move the `simple_script.py` inside the `code` directory.
8. Rename the python script `hello_world.py`.
9. Delete the `do_not_readme.md` file.

To check your work, you can run `$ tree` in the `testing_directory`. Your output should look like this.

```
├── code
│   └── hello_word.py
├── data
│   └── raw_data
├── readme.md
└── test
```
