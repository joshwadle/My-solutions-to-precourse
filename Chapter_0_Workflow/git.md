# Version control with Git and GitHub
<!-- TODO: put this assignment here and learnerize it -->
The key takehome message: **Always be committing**. Now let's see what that means and what tools we have for version control.
  * **git**: git is used for version control. It will be a critical part of your development workflow. Being able to rollback changes and create branches will enable you to be more confident in developing programs because you can change code and try new approaches without worrying about losing a currently working version. git is on your local machine.

  * **GitHub**:  To make it perfectly clear, git is independent of GitHub. Each copy of a git repository is independent of all the others (hence, *distributed* version control system, or dvcs). GitHub is just a place to put a copy of a repository; the benefit is that because GitHub is web-based, anybody can access that repository at anytime, which makes it an ideal place to host a master version of shared repositories. Many companies use GitHub in just that way.

[Assignment 5 - The Galvanize way ](assignments/assignment_5_gitversions.md): Here at Galvanize, we have our curriculum in git repositories hosted on GitHub. You'll be viewing, cloning, and forking those repositories quite a bit. Let's practice with [assignment_5_gitversions.md](assignments/assignment_5_gitversions.md).

**DO NOT commit large files to a Github repo (anything larger than ~20mb).**  In case you have accidentally committed a large file (or dataset) use this [tutorial](http://blog.jessitron.com/2013/08/finding-and-removing-large-files-in-git.html) or this [command line tool](http://rtyley.github.io/bfg-repo-cleaner/) to clean up your repo
