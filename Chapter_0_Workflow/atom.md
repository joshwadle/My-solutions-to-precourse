## Install a Text Editor (Atom)

During the course, we will use Atom, as it is free and works across operating systems. You can dowload it [here](https://atom.io/).

In Atom file menu, select 'Install Shell Commands'. This step will make more sense once you have gone through the next section.

NB: you can make many types of files in Atom (.sql, .py, .csv ...)

Learning and using a programming editor is a foundational skill.  If you know `vi` or `emacs`, continue to use them.  If you haven't mastered them, then `Atom` is a good option.  Editors are a personal choice and the source of bitter disputes.  Choose a professional editor which works for you.

Going further: you need to master basics skills in `vi` or `emacs`, as outlined in this [Survival Guide to vi and emacs](resources/vi_emacs_survival_kit.md).
