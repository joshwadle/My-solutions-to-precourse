#### Developing code
Everyday here you'll be writing programs in Python. You have 2 options when
you're developing:

  1. Develop in a text editor [> your tool: Atom] and run the code with the Python
     interpreter [> your tool: iPython in iTerm2]
  2. Develop in an interactive 'repl' ('repl' stand for 'read-eval-print loop'), [> your tool: iPython in iTerm2]

[Assignment 4 - part 1](assignments/assignment_4_developing.md): For the most part, you will use option 1. Option 2 (developing in a repl) is best
when you are trying out small bits of code.

Complete [assignment_4_developing.md](assignments/assignment_4_developing.md) to try out both options.

#### Interactive Development Workflow

[Assignment 4 - part 2](assignments/assignment_4_interactivedeveloping.md): When coding, you should build your programs incrementally and efficiently. This means keeping the feedback loop tight when writing code.

Complete [assignment_4_interactivedeveloping.md](assignments/assignment_4_interactivedeveloping.md) to make sure you are familiar with:
- Adding print statements
- Importing modules and Autoreload
- Interactive Debugging.
