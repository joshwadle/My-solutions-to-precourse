## Recap

Can you answer these questions:

 1. What is the difference between a list and a generator? And the advantages of either?
 2. What is the advantage of storing a word list in a set rather than a list?
 3. What is the difference between a class definition and an instantiated instance of a class?

You should be comfortable with everything below.

- Basic data structures and associated methods (int, float, string, list, dict, set, range)
- Control structures (`if`, `elif`, `else`, `while`, `for`, `break`, `continue`, `pass`) and enumerations (`for` loops, list comprehensions, `enumerate`, `zip`)
- Declaring, calling functions and keyword arguments
- Object orientation programming (Classes, Methods, instance variables, self)
- Importing modules
- Reading and writing a file

## Going Further: More resources

If you still feel new to Python, you might benefit from looking at one of these resources (books with snippets of codes or exercises):
* [Learn Python the Hard Way](http://learnpythonthehardway.org/), with the [free version](https://learnpythonthehardway.org/book/). Work your way through the exercises 0 to 39, it offers a great combination of explanations and exercises to apply the concepts. Exercises 40 to 45 are a great introduction to object oriented programming.
* [Dive Into Python](http://www.diveintopython.net/): Chapters 1 through 6 are particularly relevant to make sure you are familiar with dictionaries, lists, tuples and have some exposure to classes.
* [Effective Python](http://www.effectivepython.com/) and its associated [GitHub account](https://github.com/bslatkin/effectivepython)

If you like to follow along videos, Coursera offers some courses on programming in Python as well:
* [Learn to Program: The Fundamentals](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming1)
* [Learn to Program: Crafting Quality Code](https://www.coursera.org/course/programming2)

Python also has great documentation which is helpful if you need to look up how something is done in Python:
* [Python tutorial](https://docs.python.org/2/tutorial/)
* [Python library](https://docs.python.org/2/library/)
