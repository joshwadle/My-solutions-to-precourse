## Questions & Answers

A	confidence	interval	(CI)	is	an	interval	estimate	of	a	population	parameter

### 1. Estimating population proportion


population size of N
n are randomly selected
p answer positively
binomial distribution
average is p , variance np(1-p)

6250
259
142 good

sample mean (with np) sample proportion p
sample variance () 142 (1-0.568)^2 + 108 (0-0.568)^2/249


election
  ask every voter
  sample
  estimate on how people vote + margin of error
confidence interval (different from variance)
95%

Given	certain	conditions,	the	mean of	a	sufficiently	large	number
of	i.i.d.	random	variables,		will	be	approximately	normal,
regardless of	the	underlying	distribution
xbar is normal mu sigma^2/n as variance

Z = x bar -- mu/ sigma/sqrt(n)
